# Bulk Merge

## Description

The EF `BulkMerge` extension method let you merge (insert or update/Upsert) a large number of entities in your database.

```csharp
// Easy to use
context.BulkMerge(customers);

// Easy to customize
context.BulkMerge(customers, options => options.IncludeGraph = true);
```

### Performance Comparison

| Operations      | 1,000 Entities | 2,000 Entities | 5,000 Entities |
| :-------------- | -------------: | -------------: | -------------: |
| SaveChanges     | 4,000 ms       | To long...     | Way way to long... |
| BulkMerge       | 80 ms          | 110 ms         | 170 ms         |

### Scenarios
The `BulkMerge` method is **fast** but also **flexible** to let you handle various scenarios in Entity Framework such as:

- [Merge and keep identity value](#merge-and-keep-identity-value)
- [Merge with custom key](#merge-with-custom-key)
- [Merge and include/exclude properties](#merge-and-includeexclude-properties)
- [Merge with related child entities (Include Graph)](#merge-with-related-child-entities-include-graph)
- [Merge with future action](#merge-with-future-action)
- [More scenarios](#more-scenarios)

### What is supported?
- All Entity Framework versions (EF4, EF5, EF6, EF Core, [EF Classic](https://entityframework-classic.net/))
- All Inheritances (TPC, TPH, TPT)
- Complex Type/Owned Entity Type
- Enum
- Value Converter (EF Core)
- And more!

### Advantages
- Easy to use
- Flexible
- Increase performance
- Increase application responsiveness
- Reduce database load
- Reduce database round-trips

## Getting Started

### Bulk Merge
The `BulkMerge` and `BulkMergeAync` methods extend your `DbContext` to let you merge a large number of entities in your database.

```csharp
context.BulkMerge(customers);

context.BulkMergeAsync(customers, cancellationToken);
```

### Bulk Merge with options
The `options` parameter let you use a lambda expression to customize the way entities are inserted or updated.

```csharp
context.BulkMerge(customers, options => options.ColumnPrimaryKeyExpression = c => c.Code });
```

### Why BulkMerge is faster than SaveChanges?
Merging thousands of entities for a file importation is a typical scenario.

The `AddOrUpdate` method performs a database round-trip for every entity to check if it already exists. The `DetectChanges` change method is also called for every entity which makes this method even slower (it's like using the `Add` method instead of `AddRange`).

The `SaveChanges` method performs one database round-trip for every entity to update.

So, if you need to merge 10,000 entities, 20,000 database round-trips will be performed + 10,000 `DetectChanges` calls which is **INSANELY** slow.

The `BulkMerge` in counterpart requires the minimum number of database round-trips possible. For example, under the hood for SQL Server, a `SqlBulkCopy` is performed first in a temporary table, then a `MERGE` from the temporary table to the destination table is performed which is the fastest way available.

## Real Life Scenarios

### Merge and keep identity value
Your entity has an identity property, but you want to force to insert a specific value instead. The `MergeKeepIdentity` option allows you to keep the identity value of your entity.

```csharp
context.BulkMerge(customers, options => options.MergeKeepIdentity = true);
```

### Merge and include/exclude properties
You want to merge your entities but only for specific properties.

- `ColumnInputExpression`: This option lets you choose which properties to map.
- `ColumnIgnoreExpression`: This option lets you ignore properties that are auto-mapped.
- `IgnoreOnMergeInsertExpression`: This option let you ignore properties only for the `INSERT` part.
- `IgnoreOnMergeUpdateExpression`: This option let you ignore properties only for the `UPDATE` part.

```csharp
context.BulkMerge(customers, options => options.ColumnInputExpression = c => new { c.CustomerID, c.Name} );
            
context.BulkMerge(customers, options => options.IgnoreOnMergeUpdateExpression = c => new { c.UpdatedDate } );
```

### Merge with custom key
You want to merge entities, but you don't have the primary key. The `ColumnPrimaryKeyExpression` let you use as a key any property or combination of properties.

```csharp
context.BulkMerge(customers, options => options.ColumnPrimaryKeyExpression = c => c.Code);    
```

### Merge with related child entities (Include Graph)
You want to merge entities but also automatically merge related child entities.

- `IncludeGraph`: This option lets you automatically merge all entities part of the graph.
- `IncludeGraphBuilder`: This option lets you customize how to merge entities for a specific type.

```csharp
context.BulkMerge(invoices, options => options.IncludeGraph = true);
```

### Merge with future action
You want to merge entities, but you want to defer the execution.

By default, `BulkMerge` is an immediate operation. That mean, it's executed as soon as you call the method.

`FutureAction`: This option lets you defer the execution of a Bulk Merge.
`ExecuteFutureAction`: This option trigger and execute all pending `FutureAction`.

```csharp
context.FutureAction(x => x.BulkMerge(customers));
context.FutureAction(x => x.BulkMerge(invoices, options => options.IncludeGraph = true));

// ...code...

context.ExecuteFutureAction();
```
