### Scenarios
The `BulkDelete` method is **fast** but also **flexible** to let you handle various scenarios in Entity Framework such as:

- [Delete with custom key](#delete-with-custom-key)
- [Delete with future action](#delete-with-future-action)
- [More scenarios](#more-scenarios)

### What is supported?
- All Entity Framework versions (EF4, EF5, EF6, EF Core, [EF Classic](https://entityframework-classic.net/))
- All Inheritances (TPC, TPH, TPT)
- Complex Type/Owned Entity Type
- Enum
- Value Converter (EF Core)
- And more!

### Advantages
- Easy to use
- Flexible
- Increase performance
- Increase application responsiveness
- Reduce database load
- Reduce database round-trips

## Getting Started

### Bulk Delete
The `BulkDelete` and `BulkDeleteAync` methods extend your `DbContext` to let you delete a large number of entities in your database.

```csharp
context.BulkDelete(customers);

context.BulkDeleteAsync(customers, cancellationToken);
```

### Bulk Delete with options
The `options` parameter let you use a lambda expression to customize the way entities are deleted.

```csharp
context.BulkDelete(customers, options => options.BatchSize = 100);
```

### Why BulkDelete is faster than SaveChanges?
Deleting thousands of entities for a file importation is a typical scenario.

The `SaveChanges` method makes it quite impossible to handle this kind of situation due to the number of database round-trips required. The `SaveChanges` performs one database round-trip for every entity to delete. So, if you need to delete 10,000 entities, 10,000 database round-trips will be performed which is **INSANELY** slow.

The `BulkDelete` in counterpart requires the minimum number of database round-trips possible. For example, under the hood for SQL Server, a `SqlBulkCopy` is performed first in a temporary table, then a `DELETE` from the temporary table to the destination table is performed which is the fastest way available.

## Real Life Scenarios

### Delete with custom key
You want to delete entities, but you don't have the primary key. The `ColumnPrimaryKeyExpression` let you use as a key any property or combination of properties.

```csharp
context.BulkDelete(customers, options => options.ColumnPrimaryKeyExpression = c => c.Code);    
```

### Delete with future action
You want to delete entities, but you want to defer the execution.

By default, `BulkDelete` is an immediate operation. That means, it's executed as soon as you call the method.

`FutureAction`: This option let you defer the execution of a Bulk Delete.
`ExecuteFutureAction`: This option trigger and execute all pending `FutureAction`.

```csharp
context.FutureAction(x => x.BulkDelete(customers1));
context.FutureAction(x => x.BulkDelete(customers2));

// ...code...

context.ExecuteFutureAction();
```
